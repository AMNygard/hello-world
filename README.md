Creating a test repository

Hello to anyone reading this! I'm a soon-to-be college graduate, 
with bachelor's degrees in physics and mathematics, and almost
a third degree in computer science.

My favorite languages to work with right now are Python for
scripting, C++ for larger projects, and OpenGL for graphics
programming. I have experience with machine learning and physical
simulations, and enjoy nothing more than working with code.
